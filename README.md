I created a model of a social media service an accompaniment to my dissertation on how social media are designed to encourage compulsive behaviour.
It was developed using React and uses concepts from Human-Computer Interaction in it's design.

The idea was to retain a familar design whilst also making changes to reduce social media addiction and compulsive behaviour.
